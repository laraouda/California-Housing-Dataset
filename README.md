Predicting Median House Values: Machine Learning Regression This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the median house value based on various features related to housing and population demographics.

#Features
The dataset used in the project includes several key features that influence housing prices:
1. MedInc: Median income of households in a given area, an essential determinant of house prices since wealthier neighborhoods tend to have higher property values.
2. HouseAge: Average age of the houses in a block, as newer houses might be more expensive due to modern construction and amenities.
3. AveRooms: Average number of rooms per household, representing the size and spaciousness of homes.
4. AveBedrms: Average number of bedrooms per household, another indicator of home size.
5. Population: Total population in a block, which can impact demand and prices based on neighborhood density.
6. AveOccup: Average number of people living in each household, providing insights into population density and household size.
7. Latitude & Longitude: Geographical coordinates, which determine locationâ€”a major factor in real estate pricing.

#Goal
The objective is to predict the Median House Value for households within a block using these features. This is a regression task, where the output is a continuous numerical value rather than a category.
